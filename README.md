# JavaHotel
This was THE final Project for my Object Oriented Programming class. 
It was developed between me and a friend. 
Basically it's a Hotel Management System based in Java using a simble Relational Database developed in SQL. 
All Front-End was developed in NetBeans. 
Back-End was developed in IntelliJ. 
WARNING: All the graphical User Interface is in Spanish. 
To run the program run the SQL Script to setup the entire DataBase thx
